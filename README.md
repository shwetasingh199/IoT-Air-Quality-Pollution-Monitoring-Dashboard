# 🌍 IoT-Based Air Quality & Pollution Monitoring Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

The IoT-Based Air Quality & Pollution Monitoring Dashboard is a software-based environmental monitoring system that simulates IoT sensor readings and integrates real-time air quality information from OpenWeather APIs.

The system monitors:

* Air Quality Index (AQI)
* PM2.5 Concentration
* PM10 Concentration
* Carbon Monoxide (CO)
* Temperature
* Humidity

The collected data is visualized through an interactive Streamlit dashboard with charts, gauges, alerts, and analytics.

This project demonstrates how modern IoT monitoring systems can be designed for smart cities, environmental agencies, educational institutions, healthcare facilities, and industrial environments.
